# VSD_worskhop
The goal of the VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program is to use open-source tools to introduce participants to RISC-V architecture and VLSI chip design. Using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board, the program's central component, it offers a practical learning experience.

This development board has a 32-bit RISC-V CPU with a clock speed of 24MHz, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM. With its 15 GPIO pins for hardware interface and support for SPI, USART, and I2C, it may be used for a wide range of projects. Participants in the program develop and test hardware applications to use their understanding of the RISC-V ecosystem.
